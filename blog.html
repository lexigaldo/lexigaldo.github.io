<h1> My Favorite Toys! </h1>

<p> Dear Friends, </p>
<DIV> Ever since my mom and dad have started classes, I've had a lot of free time home alone. </DIV>
<DIV> So what better way to spend my time, than to blog about my thoughts and ideas. My mom and dad call me an "aggressive-chewer", </DIV>
<DIV> but I don't get it. What's the point of a toy if I can't destroy it. </DIV>

<p> So for my first blog, I want to write about my 5 favorite toys and their life-expectancy. </p>

<h1> 1. Red Kong </h1>

<p> This is an amaze-KONG toy. All my parent's friends rave about how this toy will never break and </p>
<DIV> boy, they were right. I have tried and tried, and it is still in tact. I'm not sure what it's made out of </DIV>
<DIV> and I haven't decided if I like the taste or not, but if I start chewing on it in front of my parents, they sometimes </DIV>
<DIV> put a bone-cookie in it or my favorite, peanutbutter! </DIV>

<p> How long did it last?: Basically immortal. </p>

<h1> 2. Mr. Quacker </h1>

<p> Mr. Quacker was my best friend, and was one of my first toys when I was first adopted. He went on almost every adventure with me like, </p>
<DIV> when I had to go outside to pee, or when I went on long car rides. The best part was, every time I chewed him, he made noises. </DIV>
<DIV> That's how I knew he was really listening to everything I had to say. I will always think of Mr. Quacker with the fondest memories. </DIV>

<p> How long did it last?: not long enough, 2 months. </p>

<h1> 3. Hide-A-Hedgie </h1>

<img src="hidinghedgies.jpg" alt="Hiding Hedgies" style="width;275px;height:300px">

<p> The hedgies were so teenie weenie, but I loved when my mom and dad hid them inside the log because then I could pull them out. </p>
<DIV> Mom and dad always tried to challenge me, but I pulled out all the hedgies in 2.5 seconds. </DIV>
<DIV> My favorite thing to do when I first woke up was to pick up a hedgie and relentlessly chew, while running around the </DIV>
<DIV> living room - squeaking loud and proud for all to hear. </DIV>

<p> How long did it last?: There are still 1 and a half. </p>

<h1> 4. Rope Bones </h1>

<img src="ropebones.jpg" alt="Rope Bones" style="width:275px;height:300px">

<p> The rope bones tasted surprisingly well. I love tug rope and I love bones, so it seemed like the perfect toy. </p>
<DIV> Until, my mom and dad started finding pieces of rope in my poop (oops!). I guess I was eating a little too much. </DIV>
<DIV> But, once I set my mind to chewing, I can't be stopped. </DIV>

<p> How long did it last?: rope, long deaaaddddddd; bones, still here yay

<h1> 5. **SHHHH TOP SECRET SHHHH** </h1>

<img src="nike.jpg" alt="Sneakers" style="width: 275px;height:300px">

<p> I had to put a disclaimer incase my parents saw, since this is an unofficial, but official toy. </p>
<DIV> But, boy do I love sneakers. I have really really really like the really nice, expensive ones. They taste better! </DIV>
<DIV> At first, I thought mom and dad left their shoes out for me to play with, but then they started putting them where I couldn't reach </DIV>
<DIV> and I got the hint, they weren't meant for play. But sometimes, mom and dad forget and I can't help myself. </DIV>

<p> How long did it last?: less than one of mom and dad's 50-minute lectures. </p>
